# PnP_AP_Provisioning
PnP AP Provisioning via Cisco Catalyst Center


This sample application was developed in Python and requires Cisco Catalyst Center, Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers. The application's roadmap includes automated Access Point (AP) assignment to site/floor.

The Challenge:
•	Mass Access Points deployment
•	Ongoing large wireless hardware refresh
•	Time required to provision Access Points

The Goal:
•	Automate the workflow to onboard APs so that no Network Engineer time is required.

The Solution:
•	Use APIs to facilitate Integration between Cisco DNA Center, Wireless LAN Controllers.

The Results:
•	Lower cost of wireless deployments
•	Increased accuracy and visibility

Business Summary
Simplify the Access Point deployments with an automation tool based on the Cisco DNA Center REST APIs.
